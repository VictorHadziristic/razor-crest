                <b>Click the image to turn half the car red!<br></b>
                I took this royalty free image of a yellow car, edited it in Adobe Photoshop so that half of the car is painted red.
                I used the selection tool to select half of the car, and modified it's hue in a new layeer. To illustrate this
                you can click on the image and it will alternate between the original and the edited version.

            <b>Click the image to see that it has a transparent background!<br></b>
            I created this logo in Adobe Illustrator, so its source it is a vector image. I exported it to a .PNG with a transparent background.
            If you click the image, it will change the CSS styling of its container, and you can see that the logo has transparency.

    <h1>Lab question responses</h1>
    <h2><b>1. What's your modification? Any thoughts(why)? Steps?</b></h2>
    <p>
        For the first image on this page, I modified the image so that half of the car would be a different color. I used photoshop
        to accomplish this. I selected half of the image, placed it into a new layer, selected the colored part of the car using
        the selection tool and modified that selection using Photoshop's Hue/Saturation menu. I thought that making this modification
        along with the interactive component on this page would be a neat example to show off image modifications.
    </p>
    <h2><b>2. What are the differences you notice from the modification (e.g., file size change? Quality change?)</b></h2>
    <p>
        The image is originally a JPEG, which is a lossy format. Once I made my modifications, I exported the image as a PNG, a lossless format.
        The interactive component above loads either the orignial JPEG or the modified PNG, if you look closely, there really isn't a noticeable
        differnece in quality. This goes to show that there isn't much argument for lossless over lossy formats when it comes to web development.
        But the difference lies in the filesize, you might even notice that your first click on the component will cause a hiccup and refresh the page.
        This stems from the fact that the PNG is nearly 6 times the size of the JPEG version.
    </p>
    <h2><b>3. Is there any special consideration when you created/drew the new image(s)? What were the steps?</b></h2>
    <p>
        I thought I would make a logo for this example, and I wanted to demonstrate one of the characteristics of a particular format,
        namely, PNG. I drew up the logo in Illustrator, selected PNG as the output format and selected "transparent background".
        Now I could not really show off that the image indeed had a transparent background if it was sitting on a static white background.
        So I made a little front-end code so that when the user clicks on it, the CSS styling changes the background of the image,
        and this demonstrates that the image does indeed have an alpha channel, which is what controls pixel transparency.

    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <h2><b>1. How hard do you rate this lab in a range 1-10, where 1 is easiest, 10 is the hardest?</b></h2>
    <p>
        I would rate this Lab a 7/10. I have quite a bit of experience using Photoshop and Illustrator, so creating examples
        was trivial for me. But I would imagine this process would take some students a little bit more time.
    </p>
    <h2><b>2. Whatâ€™s the difficulty?</b></h2>
    <p>
        The difficult part is spending the time to find royalty free images, editing them and creating an illustration. This
        really isn't that difficult, but I added my own spin to make this lab interactive, which added a bit of complexity.
    </p>
    <h2><b>3. How did you solve it?</b></h2>
    <p>
        I completed this lab using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for my example images, thought of some ways to demonstrate
        some more of the course material. Then I used Angular front-end code to make the images interative.
    </p>
    <h2><b>4. Is it Fun? </b></h2>
    <p>
        I would say this lab is kind of fun, especially when I got to put my own creative spin on it.
