    <h1>Why usability is important?‚Äã</h1>
    <p>The usability of a website is essentially part of the user's experience with a company. In essence, it is a part of customer service. A customer can go to a variety of companies to fulfill a need.

    </ol>

        <li>Make sure that plugins and applets are available to everyone by testing them to be sure.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Which of these principles are used on this website?</h2>
    <ol class="answers"> 
        <li>The website is easy to navigate.</li>
        <p>Every page on the website is accessbile via the toolbar on the top, which is available on every page.</p>
        <li>The home page should include all the most important links in your website.</li>
        <p>The home page of this website includes the the toolbar which contains all of the links for navigation within the website.
            On top of this I have included a link to the GitHub repo on the home page where the user can navigate away from the site, and view the source code.
        </p>
        <li>Avoid using horizontal scrolling.</li>
        <p>This website makes no use of horizontal scrolling.</p>
        <li>Display information in a variety of ways ‚Äì some visitors might like reading through info, others might like visuals or audio files.</li>
        <p>I have made use of this principle on this very page, I have used a combination of text and images to highlight
            the individual sections, making them more distinct and memorable to the reader.
        </p>
        <li>Different items on a page should be aligned consistently.</li>
        <p>The pages on this webiste make use of a grid system, so everything is consistently aligned.</p>
        <li>Be consistent in how you alert a user as to which elements are clickable.</li>
        <p>The buttons which are clickable on the website, have color cues to alert the user that it is possible to interact with it.</p>
        <li>Highlight important headings visually, this will help readers find the information.</li>
        <p>Not only have I highlighted headings by bolding them, I have also varied their sizes, creating a visual way of interpreting the structure of given body of text.</p>
        <li>In my development of this webiste, I have ensured that every image, animation and other form of media features alternative text for accessibility purposes.</li>
        <p>Should the styling of the website fail, each multimedia asset has alternate text element to describe what was supposed to be there.</p>
        <li>All of the information on the page is accessible without the use of a style sheet.</li>
        <p>The website's markup is written pretty neatly, so should the sytling fail, all of the information is still readible.</p>
        <li>The website doesn't make use of any plugin or applet that wouldn't be available to a standard browser setup.</li>
        <p>This website will run with any browser out of the box, so it should not interfere with accessibility.</p>  
    </ol>
